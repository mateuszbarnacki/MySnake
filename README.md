# MySnake

I made this project by accident. It's a result of animation and key events tests. User can control the snake using keyboard arrows. The game ends when the snake
hits the wall or it's body. Then player is informed by dialog window about the end of the game and score. User has a chance to play again or close the game. I decided to use 
serialization to store the top score.
